    "summary": "Learned Senior counsel also pointed out that in respect of the two mortgages dated 16.03.1995 and 17.04.1995, the High Court in Second Appeal6 No.1235 of 2014 (which emanated from a suit for redemption filed by the respondent) passed an interim order dated 25.08.2022, directing the respondent to pay the appellant a sum of Rs.10,00,000/- 6 Hereinafter abbreviated to “SA”.11 (Rupees Ten Lakhs), being the principal and interest on both the mortgages. As the deposit alone is not intended to create the charge and the document, which constitutes the bargain regarding the security, is also necessary and operates to create the charge in conjunction with the deposit, it requires registration under Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908, as a non- testamentary instrument creating an interest in immovable property, where the value of such property is one hundred rupees and upwards. In N L Abhyankar v Union of India, (1995) 1 MhLJ 503, a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court at Nagpur considered, though in the context of delay vis-à-vis Article 226 of the Constitution, the decision in M/s Dehri Rohtas Light Railway Company Limited v District Board, Bhojpur, (1992) 2 SCC 598, and held that “The real test for sound exercise of discretion by the High Court in this regard is not the physical running of time as such, but the test is whether by reason of delay there is such negligence on the part of the petitioner, so as to infer 8 Para 21.3 of Esha Bhattacharjee (supra).28 that he has given up his claim or whether before the petitioner has moved the Writ Court, the rights of the third parties have come into being which should not be allowed to be disturbed unless there is reasonable explanation for the delay.”9 The Bombay High Court’s eloquent statement of the correct position in law found approval in Municipal Council, Ahmednagar v Shah Hyder Beig, (2000) 2 SCC 48 and Mool Chandra v Union of India, 2024 SCC OnLine SC 1878.",

In the facts and circumstances of the case, the only issue which arises for consideration is as to whether there was any default on part of the respondents in depositing the balance 2 In short “CBI” 3 In short “ED” 4amount within the time prescribed pursuant to the auction sale dated 10.04.2018 so as to attract Rule 9(4) of the Rules and allow the appellant-Bank to cancel the auction which had already been confirmed. Accordingly, we are of the considered opinion that the High Court has not committed any error of law in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case in holding that the appellant- Bank manifestly erred in cancelling the auction sale dated 10.04.2018 and in directing to issue sale certificate/register the sale deed in favour of the respondents after getting the balance auction amount deposited within a period of four weeks.",
